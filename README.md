# Project_Portfolio
Covid_Project_.sql- leveraged SQL to analyze COVID-19 data, extracting valuable insights from various datasets. I designed optimized queries to explore trends, infection rates, and regional impacts, helping to inform public health strategies and decision-making. Through database manipulation and querying, I contributed to a deeper understanding of the pandemic's dynamics and its effects on different populations.
Fatal_force-Used Python and data visualization techniques to dissect and communicate complex incident data effectively. By utilizing Python's data manipulation libraries, I processed and cleaned raw data from law enforcement databases, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
With a focus on enhancing insights, I employed various data visualization libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create intuitive graphs, charts, and heatmaps. These visualizations provided a comprehensive overview of incident patterns, geographical distributions, and temporal trends, aiding law enforcement agencies in making informed decisions and allocating resources more strategically.
Heart_condition-Used Python and data visualization to transform complex cardiac data into insightful visuals. Python's data manipulation capabilities helped clean and process the data, while libraries like Plotly and Seaborn created dynamic visualizations. These visuals unveiled patterns and trends, aiding medical professionals in better understanding heart conditions and enhancing patient care.
